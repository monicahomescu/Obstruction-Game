# Obstruction-Game

The game starts with an empty 6 x 6 grid of squares. Two players are involved: the `computer` and the `human` that can choose who the game should be started by (typing either 'computer' or 'human').

The players take turns in writing their symbol in an empty cell. Placing a symbol blocks all of the neighbouring cells from both players, which are indicated by shading. Computer player employs a strategy when making its moves in order to attempt to win the game and provide an entertaining opponent for the human player. The first player unable to move loses.
